Hurrah for Vim!! It is "at your fingertips" like vi, and has the extensions
that vi sorely needs: highlighting for executing commands on blocks, an easily
navigable and digestible help screen, and more.  (Paul Pax)

The reason WHY I don't have this amazingly useful macro anymore, is that I
now use Vim - and this is built in!! (Stephen Riehm, Germany)

I am a user of Vim and I love it.  I use it to do all my programming, C,
C++, HTML what ever.  (Tim Allwine)

I discovered Vim after years of struggling with the original vi, and I just
can't live without it anymore.  (Emmanuel Mogenet, USA)

Emacs has not a bit of chance to survive so long as Vim is around.  Besides,
it also has the most detailed software documentation I have ever seen---much
better than most commercial software!  (Leiming Qian)

This version of Vim will just blow people apart when they discover just how
fantastic it is! (Tony Nugent, Australia)

I took your advice & finally got Vim & I'm really impressed.  Instant convert.
(Patrick Killelea, USA)

Vim is by far my favorite piece of shareware and I have been particularly
pleased with version 3.0.  This is really a solid piece of work.  (Robert

of the free software world.  (Louis-David Mitterand, U
