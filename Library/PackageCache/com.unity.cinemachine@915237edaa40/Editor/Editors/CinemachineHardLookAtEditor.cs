$obj = add($obj, $y, undef);

with the same result as

    $obj = [\$obj, \$foo];

Even if no I<explicit> assignment-variants of operators are present in
the script, they may be generated by the optimizer.
For example,

    "obj = $obj\n"

may be optimized to

    my $tmp = 'obj = ' . $obj;  $tmp .= "\n";

The symbol table is filled with names looking like line-noise.

This bug was fixed in Perl 5.18, but may still trip you up if you are using
older versions:

For the purpose of inheritance every overloaded package behaves as if
C<fallback> is present (possibly undefined).  This may create

Overloading was triggered or not based on the I<previous> class of the
tie()d variable.

This happened because the presence of overloading was checked
too early, before any tie()d access was attempted.  If the
