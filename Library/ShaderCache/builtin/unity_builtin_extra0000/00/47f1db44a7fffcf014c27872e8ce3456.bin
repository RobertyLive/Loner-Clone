, your changes are committed and there's no
	turning back.  You can configure the Vim editor to produce backup
	files; see |07.4|.


DISCARDING CHANGES

Sometimes you will make a sequence of changes and suddenly realize you were
better off before you started.  Not to worry; Vim has a
quit-and-throw-things-away command.  It is: >

	:q!

Don't forget to press <Enter> to finish the command.

For those of you interested in the details, the three parts of this command
are the colon (:), which enters Command-line mode; the q command, which tells
the editor to quit; and the override command modifier (!).
   The override command modifier is needed because Vim is reluctant to throw
away changes.  If you were to just type ":q", Vim would display an error
message and refuse to exit:

	E37: No write since last change (use ! to override) ~

By specifying the override, you are in effect telling Vim, "I know that what
I'm doing looks stupid, but I really want to do this."

If you want to continue editing with Vim: The ":e!" command reloads the
original version of the file.

*02.8*	Finding help

Everything you always wanted to know can be found in the Vim help files.
Don't be afraid to ask!

If you know what you are looking for, it is usually easier to search for it
using the help system, instead of using Google.  Because the subjects follow
a certain style guide.

Also the help has the advantage of belonging to your particular Vim version.
You won't see help for commands added later.  These would not work for you.

To get generic help use this command: >

	:help

You could also use the first function key <F1>.  If your keyboard has a <Help>
key it might work as well.
   If you don't supply a subject, ":help" displays the general help window.
The creators of Vim did something very clever (or very lazy) with the help
system: They made the help window a normal editing window.  You can use all
the normal Vim commands to move through the help information.  Therefore h, j,
k, and l move left, down, up and right.
   To get out of the help window, use the same command you use to get out of
the editor: "ZZ".  This will only close the help window, not exit Vim.

As you read the help text, you will notice some text enclosed in vertical bars
(for example, |help|).  This indicates a hyperlink.  If you position the
cursor anywhere between the bars and press CTRL-] (jump to tag), the help
system takes you to the indicated subject.  (For reasons not discussed here,
the Vim terminology for a hyperlink is tag.  So CTRL-] jumps to the location
of the tag given by the word under the cursor.)
   After a few jumps, you might want to go back.  CTRL-T (pop tag) takes you
back to the preceding position.  CTRL-O (jump to older position) also works
nicely here.
   At the top of the help screen, there is the notation *help.txt*.  This name
between "*" characters is used by the help system to define a tag (hyperlink
destination).
   See |29.1| for details about using tags.

To get help on a given subject, use the following command: >

	:help {subject}

To get help on the "x" command, for example, enter the following: >

	:help x

To find out how to delete text, use this command: >

	:help deleting

To get a complete index of all Vim commands, use the following command: >

	:help index

When you need to get help for a control character command (for example,
CTRL-A), you need to spell it with the prefix "CTRL-". >

	:help CTRL-A

The Vim editor has many different modes.  By default, the help system displays
the no
