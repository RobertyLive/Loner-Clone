The Vim editor has a number of options that enable you to configure and
customize the editor.  If you want help for an option, you need to enclose it
in single quotation marks.  To find out what the 'number' option does, for
example, use the following command: >

	:help 'number'

The table with all mode prefixes can be found below: |help-summary|.

Special keys are enclosed in angle brackets.  To find help on the up-arrow key
in Insert mode, for instance, use this command: >

	:help i_<Up>

If you see an error message that you don't understand, for example:

	E37: No write since last change (use ! to override) ~

You can use the error ID at the start to find help about it: >

	:help E37
