 the A in the first line:

	A young intelligent turtle ~

Now type xxxxxxx to delete "A young".  The result is as follows:

	 intelligent turtle ~

Type "u" to undo the last delete.  That delete removed the g, so the undo
restores the character.

	g intelligent turtle ~

The next "u" command restores the next-to-last character deleted:

	ng intelligent turtle ~

The next "u" command gives you the u, and so on:

	ung intelligent turtle ~
	oung intelligent turtle ~
	young intelligent turtle ~
	 young intelligent turtle ~
	A young intelligent turtle ~

	Note:
	If you type "u" twice, and the result is that you get the same text
	back, you have Vim configured to work Vi compatible.  Look here to fix
	this: |not-compatible|.
