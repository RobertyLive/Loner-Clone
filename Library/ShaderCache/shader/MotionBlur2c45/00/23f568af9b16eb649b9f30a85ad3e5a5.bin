GETTING OUT OF TROUBLE

One of the problems for Vim novices is mode confusion, which is caused by
forgetting which mode you are in or by accidentally typing a command that
switches modes.  To get back to Normal mode, no matter what mode you are in,
press the <Esc> key.  Sometimes you have to press it twice.  If Vim beeps back
at you, you already are in Normal mode.

*02.3*	Moving around

After you return to Normal mode, you can move around by using these keys:

	h   left						*hjkl*
	j   down
	k   up
	l   right

At first, it may appear that these commands were chosen at random.  After all,
who ever heard of using l for right?  But actually, there is a very good
reason for these choices: Moving the cursor is the most common thing you do in
an editor, and these keys are on the home row of your right hand.  In other
words, these commands are placed where you can type them the fastest
(especially when you type with ten fingers).

	Note:
	You can also move the cursor by using the arrow keys.  If you do,
	however, you greatly slow down your editing because to press the arrow
	keys, you must move your hand from the text keys to the arrow keys.
	Considering that you might be doing it hundreds of times an hour, this
	can take a significant amount of time.
	   Also, there are keyboards which do not have arrow keys, or which
	locate them in unusual places; therefore, knowing the use of the hjkl
	keys helps in those situ
